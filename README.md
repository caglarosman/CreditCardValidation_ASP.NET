# Credit Card Validation System on Web - ASP.NET
 
 ### 1. INTRODUCTION
 
In this project, we developed a credit card payment system. We were more interested in the front part, but also on the back, I created and coded the "Luhn Algorithm" that provides credit card verification by myself.

 ### 2. DESIGN

I used HTML, CSS and ASP.NET components in the design part.
